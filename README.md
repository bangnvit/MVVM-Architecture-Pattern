# MVVM-Architecture-Pattern

MVVM-Architecture-Pattern is a simple Android application built with Kotlin, using MVVM architecture along with LiveData and ViewModel to manage UI-related data in a clean and scalable way.

## Technologies Used:

- **Kotlin**: The programming language used for building the Android application.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A design pattern for separating concerns, making the app easier to maintain and test.
- **LiveData**: A lifecycle-aware data holder for observing changes in the UI.
- **ViewModel**: Stores UI-related data and survives configuration changes.
- **Data Binding**: Enables binding UI components in layouts to data sources in your app, minimizing the need for programmatic UI updates.
- **Jetpack Navigation**: Provides a framework for navigating between different screens in the app, simplifying the implementation of navigation and improving user experience.
- **Bottom Navigation Component**: A component for easily implementing bottom navigation in your app for quick access to top-level destinations.
- **Repository Pattern**: A design pattern that acts as an intermediary between the data source and the application. It abstracts the data access logic and provides a clean API for data operations, promoting separation of concerns and enhancing code maintainability.
- **Factory Pattern**: A creational design pattern used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created. It promotes loose coupling and enhances code maintainability.
