## Technologies Used:

- **Kotlin**: The programming language used for building the Android application.
- **MVVM Architecture**: A design pattern for separating concerns, making the app easier to maintain and test.
- **LiveData**: A lifecycle-aware data holder for observing changes in the UI.
- **ViewModel**: Stores UI-related data and survives configuration changes.
